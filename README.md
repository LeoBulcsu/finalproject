# AHAB - Film Gear Search Engine. 

For the final project of the Data Analyst Bootcamp at **IronHack**, I combined my background in filming with as much as I could of my recently acquired data knowledge. 

## Description:

**AHAB** is an application designed to streamline the process of finding film equipment among various rental shops in Madrid. It caters to production clerks, helping them efficiently locate required gear for audiovisual projects initiated by directors of photography or gaffers.

## Features:

 - **Data Extraction:** Utilized Scrapy for comprehensive data extraction from multiple rental companies' websites in Madrid.
 - **Data Transformation:** Processed and cleaned the gathered information to suit the project's requirements.
 - **Database Management:** Stored the refined data in MongoDB for efficient retrieval and management.
 - **App Development:** Created an intuitive interface using Streamlit, enabling users to input a list of required products.
 - **Smart Recommendation:** The app identifies the rental place(s) where most of the listed products are available, optimizing time and cost for production companies.

   
## Usage:

 - **Input Products:** Enter a comma-separated list of required film gear.
 - **Get Recommendations:** Receive recommendations on the rental shop(s) where the majority of the listed items are available.
